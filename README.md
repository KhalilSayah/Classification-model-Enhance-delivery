# A little introduction…
Alphabit, host of the competition, is an Algerian university club (ESI) focused on artificial intelligence.
The competition was in the form of a 36h datathon, hosted on Kaggle, it had 3 challenges (Regression — Classification — Clustering).
In this article we will focus on the first classification challenge, I will try to explain my approach and document my code as well as I can.

# How can we enhance delivery ? (Alpha.ai Challenge)
In this challenge, a dataset of delivery orders placed by a delivery service was received. Each row in the dataset represented an order, and the target variable is the status of the order (delivered or undelivered). Our task was to build a model that could predict the delivery status of an order based on the available data.
